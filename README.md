# Global-Ionospheric-TEC-Variability-Long-Term-Spectral-Wavelet-Analysis
This study explores how the Earth’s ionosphere changes during Solar Cycles 24 and 25 (2010–2024) and how it responds to geomagnetic storms. Using global Total Electron Content (GTEC) and geomagnetic indices (Kp and Dst), we identify key repeating patterns, especially a strong 27-day cycle from the Sun's rotation and seasonal variations.
